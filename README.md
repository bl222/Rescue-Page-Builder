# Rescue-Page-Builder

version 0.1

[Demo available here](http://www.benoit-code.ca.asp1-8.phx1-2.websitetestlink.com/)

A page builder that isn't tied to any platform. It can be used in any website or web application without requiring any JavaScript library or specific backend technology.

There are many page builders out there, such as visual composer, but they often are tied to a particular platform. For instance, visual composer is tied to wordpress. Rescue Page Builder is meant to be usable anywhere, regardless of wheter a CMS or framework is used or not, and wheter the backend is implemented in PHP or .net or other. It is also meant to be independant of database engine. Rescue Page Builder can be made to work with any SQL based database engine or Nosql solution.

Rescue Page Builder is coded in pure ES6 to avoid dependance to libraries. It has been tested in the latest versions of chrome, firefox, opera and edge. It should be possible to use a transpiler such as babel to convert Rescue Page Builder into ES5 thus increasing browser support, but this hasn't been tested yet.

Note that Rescue Page Builder is a very early project and so incomplete. In particular, the UI needs improvements, both visualy and functionaly.
