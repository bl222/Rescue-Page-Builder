NOTE: The demo has limited capabilities, but these can be extended. More info on this once the doc is written.

A page builder that isn't tied to any platform. It can be used in any website or web application without requiring any JavaScript library or backend technology

There are several page builders, such as Visual Composer, but often they are tied to a specific platform. For instance, visual composer is
tied to Wordpress. Rescue Page Builder on the hand isn't tied to any platform. It can technically be used in any website, no matter the 
technologie behind it. It doesn't matter if the web sites uses PHP, .net, ruby, etc. It doesn't matter is a CMS or framework is used or not. Rescue
Nor does it matter if your site uses a SQL database, a NOSQL soluiton or no database of any kind. Page Builder can be integrated anywhere. 

Rescue page builder is coded in pure ES6 so it doesn't require any Javascript library. The minified version of
Rescue has been transpiled to ES5 using babel and then minified. The ES6 code has been tested in the latest version of Firefox, Edge,
Chrome and Opera. In theory, the ES5 code should run on some version of IE that doesn't run the ES6 code, but this hasn't been tested
yet.
